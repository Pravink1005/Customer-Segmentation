Project Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on common characteristics. This project aims to implement a customer segmentation model using clustering techniques. The primary goal is to understand customer behavior, which will enable more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.

Objectives
      •	Identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior and other relevant factors.
      •	Provide actionable insights for marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer relationship management.
Data
Source
The data used in this project is sourced from [provide data source, e.g., a CSV file, a database, or an online repository].

Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
      •	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
      •	Gender: Gender of the customer
      •	Age: Age of the customer
      •	Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars
      •	Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior
Preprocessing Steps
      •	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies.
      •	Feature Engineering: Creating new features if necessary.
      •	Normalization/Standardization: Scaling features to ensure they contribute equally to the distance calculations in clustering.
Methodology
Clustering Algorithm
The primary clustering algorithm used in this project is K-Means. The choice of K (number of clusters) is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.

Steps:
      •	Elbow Method: Plot the Within-Cluster-Sum of Squared Errors (WSS) to find the optimal number of clusters.
      •	Silhouette Analysis: Evaluate the quality of clustering to confirm the number of clusters chosen.
Tools and Libraries
      •	Python: Programming language used for implementation
      •	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
      •	NumPy: For numerical operations
      •	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
      •	Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, particularly K-Means clustering
Results
      •	Cluster Analysis: Detailed analysis of each cluster, describing the characteristics and behaviors of customers in each segment.
      •	Business Insights: Recommendations for marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment.
Conclusion
This project successfully segmented customers into distinct groups, providing valuable insights into customer behavior. These insights can be leveraged to improve marketing efforts and enhance customer satisfaction.
